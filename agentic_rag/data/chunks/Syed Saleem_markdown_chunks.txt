- Developed chatbots which use Generative AI (GenAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to deliver personalized and context-aware responses, enhancing user engagement and satisfaction.
- Applied NLP techniques using transformer-based models (e.g., BERT, GPT) for natural language understanding and generation, enhancing the chatbot's ability to process and generate contextually accurate responses based on user input and domain-specific language.
- Developed and implemented custom web scraping pipelines using Python libraries (e.g., Scrapy, BeautifulSoup) to gather domain-specific data from websites and APIs, ensuring the chatbot model is continuously fed with high-quality, relevant data to enhance its understanding and response capabilities.

[Chunk 5]
- Implemented a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework to improve the chatbot's response generation by integrating external knowledge sources, thereby enhancing the richness of the interaction.
- Evaluated the RAG framework by assessing retrieval accuracy and response quality, leveraging precision-recall metrics for retrieval and BLEU/ROUGE scores to measure the relevance quality of generated responses.
- Utilized Vector Databases to store and retrieve embeddings efficiently, facilitating quick and accurate similarity searches for improved user query handling.
- Utilized LangChain for advanced conversational capabilities and workflow automation, enhancing the chatbot's ability to manage complex dialogues and tasks.
- Fine-tuned LLMs using domain-specific datasets to optimize the chatbot's performance, ensuring high accuracy and relevance in conversations.

[Chunk 6]
- Fine-tuned LLMs using domain-specific datasets to optimize the chatbot's performance, ensuring high accuracy and relevance in conversations.
- Integrated Hugging Face Transformers to leverage pre-trained LLMs, streamlining fine-tuning and deployment processes for domain-specific applications, enhancing response quality and model adaptability.
- Implemented Agentic AI to enable autonomous decision-making and dynamic task management, enhancing the chatbot's adaptability in real-time interaction
- Deployed the chatbot on AWS using Bedrock for scalable model training and inference, ensuring reliable and efficient performance under varying load conditions.
- Developed and deployed scalable RESTful APIs with FastAPI, enabling real-time communication between the chatbot and external systems for data retrieval and model inference.

[Chunk 7]
- Implemented LLMOps pipelines using Docker and custom orchestration scripts, streamlining versioning, deployment, and monitoring workflows specifically tailored for large language models (LLMs), ensuring efficient and reliable production performance.
- Coordinated cross-functional efforts to integrate domain-specific knowledge into Generative AI models, ensuring the system met both technical and business requirements.
